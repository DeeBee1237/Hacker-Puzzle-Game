# Hacker-Puzzle-Game
This is a simple text based Java Program that lets you play a hacker game I came up with when I was bored.
the program displays a square matrix (you can change the size to any n by n dimension) 
with n randomly chosen positions for the numbers 1 to n. The objective is to 'decode' the matrix so you have all 1's in the 
first row, all 2's in the next, and all n's in the nth. You can rotate the matrix by 90 degrees, 
swap rows by entering the two row numbers that you want to swap, swap columns the same way, 
and swap individual numbers by entering 4 numbers that correspond to the row and column numbers of the 
two that you want to swap. I have included a 'take back move' operation, which uses a stack. With this
operation you can take back all your moves step by step, making mistakes less frustrating
